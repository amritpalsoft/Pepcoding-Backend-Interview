Streams are provided by Node JS 
When we see video on Youtube then we see that video loads slowly 
And that loading of Data chunk by chunk is called as Streaming 

Types of Streams:

i. readable: we read data chunk by chunk 
ii. writable: we write data
iii. duplex: both reading and writing of data 
iv. transform: manipulating data
